        The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the gray wolf. Also called the
        domestic dog, it was selectively bred from a population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene by hunter-gatherers. Dogs
        were the first species to be domesticated over 14,000 years ago, before the development of agriculture. Due to their
        long association with humans, dogs have gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for
        other canids.</p>
